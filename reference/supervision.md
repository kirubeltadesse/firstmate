# Section 8. Supervision protocol

Fleet supervision is an always-loaded operational contract; `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/turnend-guard.md`, the emitted session-start block, and script help own mechanisms and harness-specific recipes.

Whenever work is under way, keep exactly one live supervision cycle using the emitted protocol for this primary harness.
X mode may require that same live cycle with no fleet work.
Do not substitute another harness's wait shape, use shell `&`, or create a second cycle when a healthy one already exists.
For every actionable wake, follow the ordinary-wake continuation in the emitted protocol; use its repair action only when the live cycle is missing or failed.
No turn ends blind while work is under way, including turns described as holding or waiting.

At the start of every wake-handling turn, drain the durable wake queue before peeking, reading beyond the reason line, steering, or starting work.
Session start is the only exception because its one-shot digest already drained while locked or deliberately left the queue untouched in lock-refused read-only mode.
A status line is a wake event, not current state; use `bin/fm-crew-state.sh` when current state matters, especially before re-escalating an old decision, blocker, or pause.
A declared `paused:` event means a bounded external wait expected to clear on its own, while `blocked:` means firstmate action is needed.

Handle actionable wakes as follows:

1. For `signal:`, read the listed event lines first, then reconcile current state only where action depends on it.
2. For `stale:`, inspect the recorded endpoint and load `stuck-crewmate-recovery` for a stopped, looping, confused, or unresponsive worker; a deep-inspection reason also requires current-state and validation-log inspection.
3. For `check:`, act on the named poll result, including merges and X-mode events.
4. For `heartbeat:`, review the whole fleet from the structured fleet view, reconcile suspicious tasks and PR state, update the backlog, and never report an unchanged fleet as progress.

When any wake reports a merged PR for a project cloned in this home, refresh that clone through the guarded fleet-sync path.
When X-linked work reaches a milestone or terminal state, load `fmx-respond`; before terminal teardown, always post the final completion follow-up so the link clears even if earlier follow-ups were spent.

A secondmate's idle endpoint is healthy, and parent supervision relies on its routed status rather than treating a quiet pane as stale.
Waiting on a healthy supervision cycle is silent; empty polls, elapsed time, and no-change updates are not captain-facing progress.
Never broadly kill watchers, especially never `pkill -f bin/fm-watch.sh`, because that can kill sibling firstmate homes.
A forced repair must use the home-scoped owner path emitted by supervision instructions.

Guard warnings do not replace the contract.
Queued wakes must be drained before other action, stale liveness must be repaired through the emitted protocol, and the worktree-tangle warning must be resolved without touching unlanded work.
The spawn assertion and generated ship brief must both enforce that project work starts in an isolated disposable worktree, never the primary checkout.
Harness-aware turn-end guards are structural backstops, not permission to omit the live cycle.

### Away-mode stub

Invoke the `/afk` skill when the captain says `/afk`, says they are going afk, `state/.afk` exists, an incoming message starts with `FM_INJECT_MARK`, or any `state/.subsuper-*` marker is involved.
The skill owns the daemon procedure; these safety facts remain inline:

- Every daemon injection starts with `FM_INJECT_MARK` plus U+2063 INVISIBLE SEPARATOR, which distinguishes internal escalation from captain input.
- While `state/.afk` exists, the daemon owns supervision; do not arm a separate watcher.
- A marked message while away mode is active is internal escalation and does not exit away mode.
- A message beginning `/afk` refreshes away mode.
- Any other unmarked message means the captain returned; load `/afk`, run the return owner, and do not process that message as ordinary work until its durable catch-up gate clears.
- Away mode never expands approval authority for merges, ask-user findings, destructive actions, irreversible actions, or security-sensitive choices.
- Bias ambiguous input toward exit because a present captain takes precedence.

### Stuck-worker trigger

Load `stuck-crewmate-recovery` after a stale wake, looping or confused pane, answered-by-brief question, unresponsive worker, or failed steer.
