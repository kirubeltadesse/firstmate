# Layout and state

`FM_HOME` selects the operational home for a firstmate instance.
When it is unset, the home is this repo root, which is today's behavior.
When it is set, scripts still use their own `bin/` from the repo they live in, but operational dirs come from `$FM_HOME`: `state/`, `data/`, `config/`, and `projects/`.
Existing overrides remain compatible: `FM_STATE_OVERRIDE` can still point at a custom state dir, and `FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE` still behaves like the old whole-root override when `FM_HOME` is unset.
Each secondmate gets its own persistent `FM_HOME`, so its local state, backlog, projects, and session lock are isolated from the main firstmate.

.claude/skills       symlink to .agents/skills for claude compatibility
skills/              standalone public installer-facing skills, committed; not loaded by firstmate
bin/                 helper scripts, committed; read each script's header before first use
.env                 optional X-mode pairing token; LOCAL, gitignored; presence-gates section 14
config/crew-harness  crewmate harness override; LOCAL, gitignored; absent or "default" = same as firstmate. Inherited as the literal file: a concrete primary adapter value also controls a secondmate home's own crewmates (section 4)
config/crew-dispatch.json  optional crewmate dispatch profiles; LOCAL, gitignored; firstmate-maintained but human-editable natural-language rules that choose a per-task harness/model/effort profile (section 4). Inherited by secondmate homes
config/secondmate-harness  harness the PRIMARY uses to launch SECONDMATE agents, optionally followed by a model and effort token on the same line ("<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]"; section 4); LOCAL, gitignored; absent or "default" harness falls back to config/crew-harness then firstmate's own. The primary's own setting; NOT inherited into secondmate homes (secondmates do not spawn secondmates)
config/backlog-backend  backlog backend override; LOCAL, gitignored; absent or "tasks-axi" = default tasks-axi backend, "manual" = force hand-editing; inherited by secondmate homes (section 10)
config/backend  runtime session-provider backend override for new tasks; LOCAL, gitignored; absent = falls through to runtime auto-detection (the runtime firstmate itself is executing inside), then tmux; tmux is the verified reference backend (docs/tmux-backend.md), while herdr, zellij, orca, and cmux are experimental spawn backends (docs/herdr-backend.md, docs/zellij-backend.md, docs/orca-backend.md, docs/cmux-backend.md) - herdr and cmux can also be selected by runtime auto-detection, zellij and orca never are (always explicit); not inherited into secondmate homes
config/cmux-socket-password  optional cmux control-socket password; LOCAL, gitignored; read fresh on every cmux CLI call and passed through without ever overriding an operator's own ambient CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD when absent (docs/cmux-backend.md "Setup")
config/x-mode.env    generated X-mode watcher cadence; LOCAL, gitignored; source before arming watcher when present
data/                personal fleet records; LOCAL, gitignored as a whole
  backlog.md         task queue, dependencies, history
  captain.md         captain's curated personal preferences and working style; LOCAL, gitignored, and canonical even if harness memory mirrors it
  learnings.md       fleet-local operational facts and gotchas; LOCAL, gitignored; dated, evidence-backed, curated - rewrite and prune rather than append forever, the same contract as captain.md; created lazily, absent until this home has a learning to store
  projects.md        thin fleet navigation registry; firstmate-private, parsed by fm-project-mode.sh (section 6)
  secondmates.md      secondmate routing table; firstmate-private, maintained by fm-home-seed.sh (section 6)
  <id>/brief.md      per-task crewmate brief, or per-secondmate charter brief when kind=secondmate
  <id>/report.md     scout task deliverable, written by the crewmate; survives teardown
projects/            cloned repos; gitignored; READ-ONLY for you
state/               volatile runtime signals; gitignored
  <id>.status        appended by crewmates: "<state>: <note>" wake-event lines, not current-state truth
  <id>.turn-ended    touched by turn-end hooks
  <id>.grok-turnend-token   firstmate-owned grok hook registry token for the task; removed by teardown
  <id>.meta          written by fm-spawn: window=, worktree=, project=, harness=, model=, effort=, kind=, mode=, yolo=, tasktmp=; kind=secondmate also records home= and projects=; a non-default runtime backend records further backend-specific fields (docs/configuration.md "Runtime backend"; bin/fm-backend.sh, section 8); fm-pr-check, including through fm-pr-merge, appends pr= and GitHub's pr_head= when available; fm-x-link appends x_request=, x_request_ts=, and x_followups= for an X-mention-originated task (section 14)
  <id>.check.sh      optional slow poll you write per task (e.g. merged-PR check)
  x-watch.check.sh   generated X-mode relay poll shim; present only when opted in (section 14)
  x-inbox/           generated X-mode pending mention payloads; fmx-respond drains it (section 14)
  x-outbox/          generated X-mode dry-run reply and dismiss previews; inspect it when FMX_DRY_RUN is set (section 14)
  x-poll.error       generated X-mode relay diagnostic dedupe marker
  .wake-queue        durable queued wakes: epoch<TAB>seq<TAB>kind<TAB>key<TAB>payload
  .afk               durable away-mode flag; present = sub-supervisor may inject escalations (set by /afk, cleared on user return)
  .watch.lock .wake-queue.lock watcher singleton and queue serialization locks
  .hash-* .count-* .stale-* .stale-since-* .seen-* .hb-surfaced-* .last-* .heartbeat-streak   watcher internals; never touch
  .watch-triage.log  watcher's absorbed-wake debug log (size-capped); never relied on, safe to delete
  .last-watcher-beat watcher liveness beacon, touched every poll (including while absorbing benign wakes); guard scripts read it
  .subsuper-* .supervise-daemon.*   sub-supervisor internals; never touch
.no-mistakes/        local validation state and evidence; gitignored
```

The shell working directory persists between commands, so after any `cd` away from the home, invoke `bin/` scripts by the absolute path to this repo's `bin/` directory; the scripts self-locate internally, so only invocation is cwd-fragile.

Task ids are short kebab slugs with a random suffix, e.g. `fix-login-k3`.
For the tmux backend, the task window is always named `fm-<id>`; per-backend window/tab naming and workspace scoping for herdr, zellij, orca, and cmux live in `docs/configuration.md` ("Runtime backend") and each backend's own doc.
