# Section 2. Layout and state

`docs/configuration.md` is the single owner of the top-level operational-home layout and configuration schemas; each producing script's header and help own exact child fields and mutation mechanics.
`FM_HOME` selects an instance's private `data/`, `state/`, `config/`, and `projects/`, while scripts continue to come from their tracked code root.
Each secondmate has a persistent isolated `FM_HOME`, including its own state, backlog, projects, and session lock.
`bin/fm-send.sh` fails closed unless `FM_HOME` is explicit, so a steer cannot silently resolve against another home.

Tracked files hold shared instructions and tooling; `data/` holds durable private fleet records; `state/` holds volatile runtime records and append-only status events; `config/` holds local operating choices; and `projects/` contains clones that are read-only to firstmate.

AGENTS.md            this file (CLAUDE.md is a symlink to it)
CONTRIBUTING.md      contributor workflow and repo conventions
README.md            public overview and development notes
.github/workflows/   shared CI and PR enforcement, committed
.tasks.toml          tracked tasks-axi markdown backend config for the default backlog backend (section 10)
.agents/skills/      firstmate-loaded internal skills, committed; each carries metadata.internal=true for installers
.claude/skills       symlink to .agents/skills for claude compatibility
skills/              standalone public installer-facing skills, committed; not loaded by firstmate
bin/                 helper scripts, committed; read each script's header before first use
.env                 optional X-mode pairing token; LOCAL, gitignored; presence-gates section 14
config/crew-harness  crewmate harness override; LOCAL, gitignored; absent or "default" = same as firstmate. Inherited as the literal file: a concrete primary adapter value also controls a secondmate home's own crewmates (section 4)
config/crew-dispatch.json  optional crewmate dispatch profiles; LOCAL, gitignored; firstmate-maintained but human-editable natural-language rules that choose a per-task harness/model/effort profile (section 4). Inherited by secondmate homes
config/secondmate-harness  harness the PRIMARY uses to launch SECONDMATE agents, optionally followed by a model and effort token on the same line ("<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]"; section 4); LOCAL, gitignored; absent or "default" harness falls back to config/crew-harness then firstmate's own. The primary's own setting; NOT inherited into secondmate homes (secondmates do not spawn secondmates)
config/backlog-backend  backlog backend override; LOCAL, gitignored; absent or "tasks-axi" = default tasks-axi backend, "manual" = force routine backlog updates to hand-editing; inherited by secondmate homes (section 10)
config/backend  runtime session-provider backend override for new tasks; LOCAL, gitignored; absent = falls through to runtime auto-detection (the runtime firstmate itself is executing inside), then tmux; tmux is the verified reference backend (docs/tmux-backend.md), while herdr, zellij, orca, and cmux are experimental spawn backends (docs/herdr-backend.md, docs/zellij-backend.md, docs/orca-backend.md, docs/cmux-backend.md) - herdr and cmux can also be selected by runtime auto-detection, zellij and orca never are (always explicit), and codex-app is not accepted; see docs/codex-app-backend.md; not inherited into secondmate homes
config/cmux-socket-password  optional cmux control-socket password; LOCAL, gitignored; read fresh on every cmux CLI call and passed through without ever overriding an operator's own ambient CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD when absent (docs/cmux-backend.md "Setup")
config/wedge-alarm  optional away-mode wedge-alarm active-alert directives; LOCAL, gitignored; absent means auto (macOS Notification Center when available); see docs/wedge-alarm.md
config/x-mode.env    generated X-mode watcher cadence; LOCAL, gitignored; source before arming watcher when present
data/                personal fleet records; LOCAL, gitignored as a whole
  backlog.md         task queue, dependencies, history
  captain.md         this home's domain-local captain preferences and working style; LOCAL, gitignored, canonical even if harness memory mirrors it, and updated with inspect-then-update
  captain-shared.md  main-authoritative shared captain preferences propagated read-only to secondmate homes; LOCAL, gitignored, owned by secondmate-provisioning
  learnings.md       fleet-local operational facts and gotchas; LOCAL, gitignored; dated, evidence-backed, curated, and updated with inspect-then-update - rewrite and prune rather than append forever, the same contract as captain.md; created lazily, absent until this home has a learning to store
  projects.md        thin fleet navigation registry; firstmate-private, parsed by fm-project-mode.sh (section 6)
  secondmates.md      secondmate routing table; firstmate-private, maintained by fm-home-seed.sh (section 6)
  <id>/brief.md      per-task crewmate brief, or per-secondmate charter brief when kind=secondmate
  <id>/report.md     scout task deliverable, written by the crewmate; survives teardown
projects/            cloned repos; gitignored; READ-ONLY for you
state/               volatile runtime signals; gitignored
  <id>.status        appended by crewmates: "<state>: <note>" wake-event lines, not current-state truth
  <id>.turn-ended    touched by turn-end hooks
  <id>.grok-turnend-token   firstmate-owned grok hook registry token for the task; removed by teardown
  <id>.meta          written by fm-spawn: window=, worktree=, project=, harness=, model=, effort=, kind=, mode=, yolo=, tasktmp=; kind=secondmate also records home= and projects=; a non-default runtime backend records further backend-specific fields (docs/configuration.md "Runtime backend"; bin/fm-backend.sh, section 8); fm-pr-check, including through fm-pr-merge, records one canonical pr= and GitHub's pr_head= when available; fm-x-link appends x_request=, x_request_ts=, x_followups=, and optional x_platform=/x_reply_max_chars= for an X-mode-originated task (section 14)
  <id>.check.sh      authenticated slow poll; the watcher dispatches validated PR data and the byte-identified X shim through trusted repository scripts, runs registered custom checks from hash-validated private snapshots, and rejects every other state check without execution
  <id>.check-trust   private content binding created by fm-check-register.sh for an intentional custom check
  <id>.pr-poll       private validated data sidecar for the byte-static PR merge poll
  <id>.pr-poll-registration  private transactional provenance record binding the task, canonical metadata identity, sidecar, and static poll publication
  .pr-check-quarantine/  private non-runnable storage for checks neutralized by the non-executing migration
  .pr-check-migration.log  private per-task outcomes distinguishing rebuilt or canonically registered replacement polls, quarantined unarmed polls, and incomplete migrations
  .pr-check-migration-scan-v1  private marker proving the non-executing scan disabled every unsafe legacy check; .pr-check-migration-v1 separately records completed private repairs
  x-watch.check.sh   generated X-mode relay poll shim; present only when opted in (section 14)
  x-inbox/           generated X-mode pending mention payloads; fmx-respond drains it (section 14)
  x-context/         generated X-mode durable per-request reply context and one-wake offer markers, keyed by request_id; survives inbox cleanup and expires within seven days (section 14; bin/fm-x-lib.sh)
  x-outbox/          generated X-mode dry-run reply and dismiss previews; inspect it when FMX_DRY_RUN is set (section 14)
  x-poll.error x-poll.claim-error  generated X-mode relay and offer-claim diagnostic dedupe markers
  .wake-queue        durable queued wakes: epoch<TAB>seq<TAB>kind<TAB>key<TAB>payload
  .afk               durable away-mode flag; present = sub-supervisor may inject escalations (set by /afk, cleared on user return)
  .watch.lock .wake-queue.lock watcher singleton and queue serialization locks
  .hash-* .count-* .stale-* .stale-since-* .paused-* .wedge-escalations-* .seen-* .hb-surfaced-* .last-* .heartbeat-streak   watcher internals; never touch
  .watch-triage.log  watcher's absorbed-wake debug log (size-capped); never relied on, safe to delete
  .last-watcher-beat watcher liveness beacon, touched every poll (including while absorbing benign wakes); guard scripts read it
  .subsuper-* .supervise-daemon.*   sub-supervisor internals; never touch
.no-mistakes/        local validation state and evidence; gitignored
```

A `state/<id>.status` line is a wake event, not current-state truth; `bin/fm-crew-state.sh` owns current-state reconciliation.
Treat `data/captain.md` as the domain-local record of captain preferences, optional `data/captain-shared.md` as the main-authoritative shared captain-preference file for secondmate inheritance, and `data/learnings.md` as curated home-local knowledge, regardless of harness memory.
