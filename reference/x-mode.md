# X mode

X mode lets a firstmate instance answer public mentions of the shared `@myfirstmate` bot on X, and act on actionable mention requests, in firstmate's own voice, from its live fleet state.
It ships inside this repo for every user but is **inert until opted in**, so a user who never enables it sees zero behavior change.

**Activation is `.env` presence, not a command.**
Put one value, `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN`, into a `.env` file at this home's root (`.env` is gitignored).
That token is the whole consent, including standing authorization for normal reversible lifecycle actions from mention requests, and the only required config; the relay derives the tenant from it.
It is not consent for destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive actions; those still require trusted-channel confirmation first.
`FMX_RELAY_URL` is optional and defaults to `https://myfirstmate.io`; only a developer pointing at a local relay sets it.

**Mechanism.**
Bootstrap wires the relay poll automatically and purely additively from `.env` presence; see `docs/configuration.md` "X mode (.env)" for the generated-artifact mechanism, the wire protocol, and the watcher-backbone non-interference guarantee.

**Cadence.**
An X instance polls every 30s instead of the default 300s.
To get that, arm the watcher with the X cadence sourced, exactly as section 8 describes but prefixed:

```sh
[ -f config/x-mode.env ] && . config/x-mode.env
bin/fm-watch-arm.sh        # as the harness's tracked background task
```

The sourced file exports `FM_CHECK_INTERVAL=30` into the arm, which the watcher it forks inherits, so only an X instance speeds up; a non-X instance has no such file and keeps the 300s default.
Because `bin/fm-watch.sh` reads `FM_CHECK_INTERVAL` only at process start and the arm no-ops on an already-healthy watcher, a cadence **transition** (opt-in while a watcher is already running, or opt-out) is applied by restarting the home-scoped watcher with the new environment: `[ -f config/x-mode.env ] && . config/x-mode.env; bin/fm-watch-arm.sh --restart` (omit the source on opt-out so the 300s default returns), run as the harness's tracked background task.
Bootstrap deliberately does not restart the watcher itself - it must never block, and `fm-watch-arm.sh --restart` is home-scoped (never a broad `pkill`).
X mode is also a reason to keep the watcher armed even with no fleet work, so an X-only user is still served.
Cadence under away-mode (the supervise daemon owns the watcher then) is a separate follow-up and out of scope here; while afk is active the daemon's default cadence applies.

**Answering.**
On an `x-mention <request_id>` or `x-mode-error ...` `check:` wake, load `fmx-respond` (section 13).
It owns mention classification, acting on the request, reply composition, voice, thread-splitting, image attachments, dry-run preview, and the completion-follow-up procedure in full, including what an `x-mode-error` wake means instead.
`docs/configuration.md` "X mode (.env)" has the wire-protocol reference.
The one fact that must survive here because it fires on a generic terminal wake, not the mention wake itself: when an X-linked task reaches a terminal state, post its final completion follow-up per section 8's wake-handling step before tearing down.
